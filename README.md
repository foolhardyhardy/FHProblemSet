# FHProblemSet
Here place some problems I designed for exercise.

## Structure of a Problem
Every problem in this set contains a "description.md", which specify the problem itself, and a 
"evaluation.md", which specify how to evaluate a solution to the problem.
Depending on the characteristics of a certain problem, sometimes a autograder is possible, in which case I would try to provide it. However, in many cases the desired properties of a solution to a certain problem might only be checked by hand, which render the necessity of "evaluation.md".

## Possible Future
