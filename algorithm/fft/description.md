# FFT
The purpose of this problem is help you get familiar with the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm and also those related features like complex number type in a programming language.

The input for this problem contains two parts: N is the length of the sequence, {x_k} are the sequence, with the following format  
```
N x1 x2 ... xn
```

Your job is solve the problem in the file named "solution", which read in the input and print the output as
```
X1 X2 ... Xn
```
